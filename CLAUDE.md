## Architecture

**10xFiszki** is an AI-powered flashcard generator. Users paste text and AI generates flashcards from it.

- **Astro v6** runs in SSR mode (`output: "server"`) — all routes are server-rendered by default
- TypeScript path alias: `@/*` → `./src/*`

### Request flow

```
Browser → Astro middleware (populates Astro.locals.user) → Page or API route
```

Middleware at `src/middleware.ts` runs on every request, checks the Supabase session cookie, and populates `context.locals.user`. `PROTECTED_ROUTES` in that file is the single source of truth for route protection.

### Auth form pattern

Forms POST to API routes (not `fetch`) to avoid CORS and keep credentials server-side. API routes redirect on both success and error — errors are passed as encoded query params (`?error=...`), which the Astro page reads and forwards as props to the React form component.

```
SignInForm.tsx (React) → POST /api/auth/signin (Astro endpoint) → redirect → signin.astro reads ?error → passes to <SignInForm error={...} />
```

### Supabase client

Always create the client with the request context — never import a singleton. See `@src/lib/supabase.ts`.

`SUPABASE_URL` and `SUPABASE_KEY` are declared `context: "server"` in `astro.config.mjs` — they are not available in client-side code.

### Component conventions

- React components live in `src/components/`; form components are client-only (`client:load`)
- Use `cn()` from `@/lib/utils` for conditional Tailwind class merging
- Button variants are defined with CVA in `src/components/ui/button.tsx` — extend there, don't add inline variant logic elsewhere
- `FormField` wraps inputs with icon, error, and hint layout — use it instead of raw `<input>`

## CI

See `@.github/workflows/ci.yml`. Pre-commit hook runs `lint-staged`: ESLint on `.ts/.tsx/.astro`, Prettier on `.json/.css/.md`.

## 10xDevs AI Toolkit - Module 2, Lesson 1

Move from sprint-zero setup to project orchestration with the **roadmap chain**:

```
(Module 1 foundation docs) -> /10x-roadmap -> backlog-ready roadmap items
```

`/10x-roadmap` is the lesson focus. `/10x-new` is intentionally introduced in Module 2, Lesson 2, when a selected roadmap item becomes an implementation change folder.

### Task Router - Where to start

| Skill | Use it when |
| --- | --- |
| **Roadmap (lesson focus)** | |
| `/10x-roadmap` | You have `context/foundation/prd.md` and a scaffolded project baseline, and you need a vertical-first MVP roadmap. The skill reads the PRD, inspects the code baseline, uses available foundation docs such as `tech-stack.md`, `infrastructure.md`, and `deploy-plan.md`, then writes `context/foundation/roadmap.md`. Use it BEFORE creating per-change folders or implementation plans. |
| **Re-run upstream if needed** | |
| `/10x-shape` / `/10x-prd` / `/10x-tech-stack-selector` / `/10x-bootstrapper` / `/10x-agents-md` / `/10x-infra-research` | Bundled from Module 1 so foundation contracts can be fixed before roadmap sequencing. If roadmap generation exposes a PRD gap, repair the PRD before pretending the backlog is ready. |

### How the chain hands off

- `/10x-roadmap` bridges product and implementation. It does not choose frameworks, design schemas, or write a per-change implementation plan.
- The output is `context/foundation/roadmap.md`: ordered milestones, vertical slices, bounded foundations, dependencies, unknowns, risk, and backlog handoff fields.
- Roadmap items should receive stable human-readable identifiers in backlog tools. The actual `context/changes/<change-id>/` folder is created in Lesson 2 with `/10x-new`.

### Roadmap boundaries

- Default to vertical slices: user-visible outcomes that cross UI, data, business logic, and integrations.
- Horizontal work is allowed only as a bounded enabler that names the downstream vertical milestone it unlocks.
- Avoid orphan horizontal work such as "build the whole database", "build all API endpoints", or "design the whole UI" before the first user-visible flow.
- Roadmap is not a calendar estimate. Do not invent dates, story points, or sprint velocity unless the user explicitly asks for a separate planning artifact.

### Foundation paths used by this lesson

- `context/foundation/prd.md` - input
- `context/foundation/tech-stack.md` - optional input
- `context/foundation/infrastructure.md` - optional input
- `context/deployment/deploy-plan.md` - optional input
- `context/foundation/roadmap.md` - output
- `context/foundation/lessons.md` - recurring rules and pitfalls
- `docs/reference/contract-surfaces.md` - load-bearing names registry

Skills must not write to `context/archive/`. Archived changes are immutable; if a resolved target path starts with `context/archive/`, abort with: "This change is archived. Open a new change with `/10x-new` instead."
